**Duration:** 1583 s
**Description:**
ANYmal successfully navigates, crosses the slab, climbs the stairs, and enter the container.
This is the actual demo for ORCA. Note that from the start until the robot is about to cross the slab the localisation
is active. After the slab routine is started, the user navigates the robot
using only live feed from sensors and not the prior map because the robot is not
localised anymore.
